"Hello Youtube"
//in this video we will learn how to initialize arrays in Swift.

//the first way, is to use the [] method.

var f = [Int]()
//Int, indicates the array can hold integers.

//the other way is to use pointy brackets

var g = Array<String>()
//these two will work identically
print(g)
print(f)
//thats all for today!
