# Oblivisual

Oblivisual, meaning "the state of being forgotten", is a programming language meant for creating canvas graphics, through
an incredible amount of tools, utilities, and language abstractions that allow you utilize the power of computing to create images. The images are
all created via the HTML5 canvas element, in a compressed, oneline html string.

The principle of abundant abstraction powers the core of the Oblivisual language. At the lowest level, simple commands can
create pictures like this:

```
>,50,_,3,<,3,^,50,^>,60,^<,50
```

###Development

The Oblivion language is currently in it's earliest stages of development. The standard library is still
underway.
