# Oblivion

Oblivion, meaning "the state of being forgotten", is a programming language meant to use spoken, human langauge as a programming language.
The goal of the language is to use the syntax and grammars present in languages like English, to convey code and instructions to an interpreter or compiler,
without using a traditional programming language, such as `Java` or `Python`.

##Usage

Oblivion works by interpreting statements as a placement grammar.
