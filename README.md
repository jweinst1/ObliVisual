# Oblivion
Oblivion is a creative, extremely low syntax programming language, meant to emphasize fast interpretation and fast code writing. The interpreter for the language is written in Swift, and natively compiled as an executable.

##Usage

The name Oblivion, is inspired by the idea of forgetting how to code, a language that reads so well you forget you are really programming. The language itself uses a reverse operand notation, where the operator, is typed before the operands.

Here are some exmaples:

```
The Oblivion Programming Lanuage
Version 1.0.0
obl> p + 3 3
6
obl> p + 3 - 6 - 5 6 7
17
obl> p + 3 + 3 4
10
obl> p * 4 3 + 47
564
obl> close
logout
```

Here, the `p` command is equivalent for standard output, or `print` in other languages. The `+` operator sums integers together, and sums any integer after it. The other math operators work similarly.
